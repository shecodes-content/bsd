# BSD and DARPA

- at the U of Berkeley students improved AT&T's UNIX codebase
- whoever ran the code had to purchase a $260.000 license from AT&T
- US mulitary wanted to consolidate the computer projects they funded to use only one platform/OS
- BSD Unix won over VMS
- DARPA funded development of BSD (multi million dollar)
- also funded a separate entity to implement the new network stack TCP
- the people at Berkeley did TCP anyway (for free), because they thought they can do better, which turned out to be true
- released the network code to the public under the newly created BSD license (pay $1000 to get a tape and a piece of paper or just download for free)
- Bill Joy was leading the team
- he also invented vi
- later released a full BSD-licensed system to the public
- "write a utility and get your name in the light"
- were sued by AT&T and settled (well, won)
- Joy left and help founding Sun Microsystems at Stanford

- FreeBSD, Darwin, Mac OSX, IOS(?) are all derived from BSD
- the TCP code developed at Berkeley is in even more devices and OSes (including MS products)
